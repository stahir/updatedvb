- Plot the blindscan ontop of the spectrum scan to show tp's, save this overlay so you can pull it up and help use it to identify satellites
- Universal LNB automatic 22khz switching
- Parse more descriptors
- Look into Qcustomplot vs Qwt
- Add a RF level graph in tuning dialog
- Look into voltage:B make sure it works for both spectrumscan and blindscan, and blindscan->tuning
- lower IQ plot cpu usage, maybe make it its own dialog window
- check over diseqc switching
