- Plot the blindscan ontop of the spectrum scan to show tp's, save this overlay so you can pull it up and help use it to identify satellites
- Universal LNB automatic 22khz switching
- Parse more descriptors
- Look into Qcustomplot vs Qwt
- Add a RF level graph in tuning dialog
- do we need to retune if no tune aquired ? I think we do
- blindscan needs to find multiple tp in 10mhz block
- convert QDialogs into QWidgets
- num LNB's should be dynamic
- settings should have [save] and [cancel]
- non sequential adapters is causing issues, ie adapter0 and adapter4. Fix this
